* A student has all their classes everyday (5 days a week - 20 days in a month)

### Exclusions due to time constraints
* Unit testing for both the angular and java app
* Comments within code
* Clean code tool (nglint, findbugs etc)
* Create a more user friendly report
* Error handling
* Frontend validation
